[Bulk API 2.0](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/bulk_api_2_0.htm)
is used to perform ingest (CRUD) and query operations against Salesforce
when working with large amounts of data. `aiosalesforce` exposes interface to perform
these operations at a high level (similar to sObject CRUD operations) and to manage
bulk jobs at a low level if needed.

!!! tip "Tip"

    Salesforce recommends using Bulk API when an operation involves more than
    2,000 records. Generally speaking, however, it depends on your particular
    use case. Creating, monitoring, and managing bulk jobs requires making at least
    7 REST API calls. With Bulk API batch limit generally being 1/10 of the REST API
    call limit it only makes sense to use Bulk API when you have more than 17 records
    in a single operation (break-even point). For slow jobs this number goes up
    due to job status polling (by default every 5 seconds).

## Ingest

Ingest operations are used to create (insert), update, upsert, or delete records.
All bulk ingest operations are performed on a single sObject type.

Response of the ingest operation is an object with the following attributes:

- `jobs` - list of `JobInfo` objects containing metadata about jobs created to
  to perform the ingest operation. A job is created for each 150,000,000 records.
  Unless you exceed this number, you will always have a single job.
- `successful_results` - list of dictionaries with successful results.
  In addition to payload data, each dictionary contains `sf__Created` and `sf__Id`
  keys. See [Salesforce documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/get_job_successful_results.htm).
- `failed_results` - list of dictionaries with failed results.
  In addition to payload data, each dictionary contains `sf__Error` and `sf__Id`
  keys. See [Salesforce documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/get_job_failed_results.htm).
- `unprocessed_records` - list of dictionaries with unprocessed records.
  Does not contain any additional keys (only original payloads).
  See [Salesforce documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_asynch.meta/api_asynch/get_job_unprocessed_results.htm).

!!! warning "Warning"

    Order of records in the response lists does not match the order of records in the
    request data. However, because each record in the response (for successful, failed,
    and unprocessed records) contains full original payload, you can use this information
    to match records in the request data with records in the response.

### High Level Operations

#### Insert

To insert records in bulk, you must provide the object name and data
(sequence of dictionaries).

```python
data = [
    {"FirstName": "Jon", "LastName": "Doe"},
    {"FirstName": "Jane", "LastName": "Doe"},
]
result = await salesforce.bulk_v2.insert("Contact", data)
record_ids = [record["sf__Id"] for record in result.successful_results]
```

#### Update

To update records in bulk, you must provide the object name and data. Data must include
`Id` field for each record.

```python
data = [
    {"Id": "0031R00001K1H2IQAV", "FirstName": "Jon", "LastName": "Doe"},
    {"Id": "0031R00001K1H2JQAV", "FirstName": "Jane", "LastName": "Doe"},
]
result = await salesforce.bulk_v2.update("Contact", data)
```

#### Delete

To delete records in bulk, you must provide the object name and data. Data must include
`Id` field for each record.

```python
data = [
    {"Id": "0031R00001K1H2IQAV"},
    {"Id": "0031R00001K1H2JQAV"},
]
result = await salesforce.bulk_v2.delete("Contact", data)
```

#### Upsert

To upsert records in bulk, you must provide the object name, external ID field name,
and data. Data must include external ID field value for each record.

```python
data = [
    {"ExternalId__c": "123", "FirstName": "Jon", "LastName": "Doe"},
    {"ExternalId__c": "456", "FirstName": "Jane", "LastName": "Doe"},
]
result = await salesforce.bulk_v2.upsert("Contact", data, "ExternalId__c")
```
