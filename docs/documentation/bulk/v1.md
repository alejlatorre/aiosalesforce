Please use [Bulk API 2.0](./v2.md).

!!! note "Note"

    Bulk API is a predecessor of Bulk API 2.0. While both provide the same functionality,
    Bulk API 2.0 has simpler workflow, better performance, and fewer limitations.
    Currently, there are no plans to implement the legacy (1.0) Bulk API in `aiosalesforce`.
